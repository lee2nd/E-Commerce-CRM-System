# E-Commerce-CRM-System

This side project was developed from 2019 and stiil upgrading.</br> 
Mainly used for 3 e-commerce platform CRM data, like yahoo, ruten and shopee and coded in excel vba language.</br> 

The feature include:
1. Automated computing.
2. Automated separating the summary information into 2 parts.
3. Thoughtful UX.
4. Concise UI.
5. Data visualization.
6. Customized drop down list.

The most difficult points:
1. With 2 user using simultaneously, and it must separate the summary information into A, B part.
2. It needed to update some platform fee ratio high frequency.
3. User can't wait too long for upgrading.

This side projects was totally completed by myself and the coding technique was trained when I was in the ACNielsen. Credited to my manager, "Lavan". Thanks!
